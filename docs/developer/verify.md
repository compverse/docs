## Fill information of your contract

Fill in the correct information of your contract

![information of your contract](/images/verify-2.png)

- Contract Address:The 0x address supplied on contract creation.

- Contract Name:Must match the name specified in the code. For example, in `contract MyContract {..}` MyContract is the contract name.

- Include nightly builds:Select yes if you want to show nightly builds.

- Compiler:The compiler version is specified in `pragma solidity X.X.X.` Use the compiler version rather than the nightly build. If using the Solidity compiler, run `solc â€”version` to check.

- EVM Version:The EVM version the contract is written for. If the bytecode does not match the version, we try to verify using the latest EVM version.

- Optimization:If you enabled optimization during compilation, select yes.

- Optimization runs

- Enter the Solidity Contract Code:We recommend using flattened code. This is necessary if your code utilizes a library or inherits dependencies.

- Try to fetch contructor arguments automatically

- ABI-encoded Constructor Arguments (if required by the contract):Add arguments in ABI hex encoded form. Constructor arguments are written right to left, and will be found at the end of the input created bytecode.
